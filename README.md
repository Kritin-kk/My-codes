All the projects I have worked on

1) This is a game called "space shooter" I created along with a Udemy online course on unity(a platform or engine for video game development which allows you to integrate sprites, visuals, animation, audio into the game) game development. It is a 2D game like space invaders with animations and sprites. You play as a spaceship that has to shoot down incoming enemies. You can collect power ups and you have 3 lives before you get eliminated. I worked on it during the summer of 2024 and it took me around 25 hours to complete. This was the first time I had used unity and coded with c-sharp(the language unity uses). It was an entirely new process for me but it was one that I thoroughly enjoyed.

 Some pictures of the game itself:

The starting menu. All the sprites and animations were provided by the course. However, the course encouraged the student to do the coding.

The game starts when you shoot the rock by clicking the space key. The top right corner records the score and the top left corner shows the number of lives you have remaining.
