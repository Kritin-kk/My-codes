All the projects I have worked on

1) Space Shooter (codes in scripts folder)

This is a game called "space shooter" I created along with a Udemy online course on unity(a platform or engine for video game development which allows you to integrate sprites, visuals, animation, audio into the game) game development. It is a 2D game like space invaders with animations and sprites. You play as a spaceship that has to shoot down incoming enemies. You can collect power ups and you have 3 lives before you get eliminated. I worked on it during the summer of 2024 and it took me around 25 hours to complete. This was the first time I had used unity and coded with c-sharp(the language unity uses). It was an entirely new process for me but it was one that I thoroughly enjoyed.

 Some pictures of the game itself:

The starting menu. All the sprites and animations were provided by the course. However, the course encouraged the student to do the coding.

The game starts when you shoot the rock by clicking the space key. The top right corner records the score and the top left corner shows the number of lives you have remaining.

End screen when all lives have been used

2) Snow Baller (codes in snowballer folder)

This is a project I worked on in Plaksha Young Technology Scholars summer school, June 2023. Me and a teammate coded an arcade style game on arduino. It ran on a small OLED screen and there was one button to control the game. In the game, a ball is shot from one end of the screen  by a snowman and by pressing the button, the player can either stop it or let it pass as it moves to a gate on  the other end of the screen. If the ball is filled, then the player must let it pass and if it is hollow the player must stop it by pressing the button. The appearance of the ball is hidden under a square until the ball reaches the gate which tests the players reaction time. The player has three lives and accumulates a score which is recorded. I had never used an Arduino before so it was a new and fun experience for me. I had to learn to code in Arduino from scratch. My teammate and I encountered many obstacles but in the end we were successful in our project. 

Here is a video of the game:

3) Python Projects(Python.py and Python Games Files)
   
These are python projects I worked on over the years. I have coded many simple games like tic tac toe, the game of nim(referred to as dragon game in the Python games folder) and a maze game. I also worked on some projects with a python course I did (in the Python.py folder). I wrote a code which sent an email to my teacher in the course and codes that perform mathematical operations like factorials.
